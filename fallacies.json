However, the appeal to closure focuses on accepting evidence and for the reason of closure.\"\nThe abstract logical form is \"Evidence X is presented, and found to be insufficient (or evaluated with a heavy bias due to the desire for closure). Closure is desired. Therefore, evidence X is accepted.\"\nThe following are some examples and their explanations of the fallacy of type \"Appeal to Closure\"\nExample #1: After the terrorist attack on the city, the citizens were outraged and wanted justice. So they arrested a Muslim man with no alibi who looked suspicious then charged him with the crime.\nExample #2: Art: Why didn’t it work out between you and Marci?Steve: It turns out that she was a lesbian.Art: Did you know she and Jack just got married?Steve: [experiences a hard hit to his ego]\nExplanation: I heard from Suzi who told Tanya who told Jennifer that Marci simply thought Steve was a jerk but fed him the classic break up line, “it’s not you, it’s me.” Steve, being the alpha male he is, couldn’t deal with this psychological trauma of not having a firm answer to why Marci didn’t want to be with him, so based on the fact that Marci once commented that a supermodel had “pretty eyes,” Steve put the issue to rest by writing Marci off as a lesbian. Steve discovered that calling Marci a lesbian was actually just him projecting his own homosexual desires on Marci. Today, Steve is living happily with his partner, Raúl, and their white Persian cat, Mr. Muffins.\nExplanation: Unfortunately, unsolved crimes are bad politically for those in charge and based on the number and percentage of false arrests, it is clear that appealing to closure has some serious consequences for many innocent people."}

Many people adopt this as a default belief. It is the belief that is what is natural must be good (or any other positive, evaluative judgment) and that which is unnatural must be bad (or any other negative, evaluative judgment).The appeal to nature fallacy is often confused with the naturalistic fallacy and the moralistic fallacy because they are quite similar. The appeal to nature, however, specifically references “natural” or “unnatural” and can also make a non-moral judgment such as “beautiful” or “destructive.”\"\nThe abstract logical form is \"X is natural.Y is not natural.Therefore, X is better than Y. That which is natural is good, right, beautiful, etc. X is natural. Therefore, X is good, right, beautiful, etc. That which is unnatural is bad, wrong, destructive, etc. X is unnatural.

Claim Y was made by source X. Therefore, claim Y must be true.   Source X is a distrusted source of information. Claim Y was made by source X. Therefore, claim Y must be false.\"\nThe following are some examples and their explanations of the fallacy of type \"Appeal to Trust\"\nExample #1: I read in the Wall Street Journal that pork bellies are a good investment. So could I borrow a million dollars to invest?\nExplanation: The Wall Street Journal could reasonably be seen as a trusted source (it doesn't matter if you agree or not, as long as the arguer thinks it is). In this case, the information appears to be more of an opinion than a fact—and an investment prediction, which by its nature is risky and therefore its truth value is questionable.\nExample #2: Cindy: I read in the Global Enquirer that Bingo Kelly, the famous movie star, is in rehab. Jack: That's poppycock! You can't trust the Global Enquirer any more than you can trust a toddler with a nail gun.\nExplanation: The Global Enquirer might not be known for its high-quality journalism and truthful reporting. However, even the most untrustworthy sources sometimes share true information. While it might be a good heuristic (rule of thumb) to be highly skeptical of any claims from such an untrustworthy source, such claims cannot be so confidently dismissed without a good reason."}

Therefore, claim X is true.\"\nThe following are some examples and their explanations of the fallacy of type \"Begging the Question\"\nExample #1: Paranormal activity is real because I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.\nExplanation: The claim, “paranormal activity is real” is supported by the premise, “I have experienced what can only be described as paranormal activity.”  The premise presupposes, or assumes, that the claim, “paranormal activity is real” is already true.\nExample #2: The reason everyone wants the new \"Slap Me Silly Elmo\" doll is because this is the hottest toy of the season!\nExplanation: Everyone wanting the toy is the same thing as it being \"hot,\" so the reason given is no reason at all—it is simply rewording the claim and trying to pass it off as support for the claim."}

Jeremy: They haven’t found it yet.\nExplanation: Jeremy is assuming the theory is correct based on some unknown missing data (the secret ingredient), rather than admitting that the whole theory is invalid.\nExample #2: Gil: Scientists have no idea what the appendix is for because they refuse to accept that its function is the source of psychic powers in humans that we have forgotten how to use. John: Scientists actually now know that the appendix serves an important role in the fetus and in young adults.  This is well documented and empirically tested. Gil: This does not mean that it still is not the source of psychic powers—this just has not been tested yet.\nExplanation: In order to protect the hypothesis from error, it is assumed, without evidence that the answer does exist, but is beyond current scientific understanding."}

If you were hypothesizing that most kids don’t have siblings, and you found this data, then it would provide more of a reason to do further research in making a more justified conclusion.\nExample #2: In looking at the difference between 100 Christians and 100 atheists, we found that Christians were significantly more likely to eat tuna fish.\nExplanation: When you fish for data, you are bound to catch something -- in this case, tuna.  Notice that because we were looking for anything, we are bound to find it."}

Very often the “weakest links” fade away into the background and the strong players lead the team.\nExample #2: It’s not a religion; it is a relationship.\nExplanation: “Yeah... wow, I can see that!” is the common response to a cliché that diverts critical thought by substitution of poetry, rhyme, or other rhetoric.  In fact, these are not arguments, but assertions absent of any evidence or reasons that rely on one's confusion of their emotional connection to language with the truth of the assertion.  Tell me why it’s not a religion.  Tell me what a relationship is exactly.Do not accept information as truth because it sounds nice."}

Unfortunately, these cannot be detected by any kind of scientific equipment.\nExplanation: While it may actually be a fact that tiny, invisible, mythological creatures are occupying this person’s opening at the lower end of the alimentary canal, it is a theory that is constructed so it cannot be falsified in any way; therefore, should not be seriously considered without significant evidence.\nExample #2: Priests can literally turn wine into the blood of Jesus.\nExplanation: Surely, we can examine the liquid and see if it at least changes chemically, can we not?  No.  Because transubstantiation is not about a physical or chemical change, but a change in “substance” -- which, of course, is not a material change and, therefore, impossible to falsify.  Furthermore, the claim is not that it “might be” happening, but it certainly is happening, adding to the fallaciousness of the claim.  The only evidence for this is some ambiguous verses in the Bible -- so ambiguous that over a billion Christians don’t subscribe to the belief that transubstantiation occurs.
